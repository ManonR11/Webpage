Most small molecule drugs interact with proteins at surface cavity levels referred to as protein pockets. Depending on their physico-chemical profiles, small molecules may not only interact with their known partners, but also target unpredicted proteins. The ligands that interact with many divers proteins are called promiscuous ligands. In some cases, their effect can be beneficial; the interaction with an off-target can lead to **drug repurposing**. In other cases, the low selectivity of small molecules lead to deleterious **side effects**.
Thanks to the growing number of *hapo* structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and the availability of PDB derived high quality databases such as **MOAD**, we can caracterize the interaction profiles of frequently co-crystallized small molecules: we can deduce one or more interaction mode(s) that can be further used for off-target prediction.<br>
During my M2 internship, I studied two appraoches: the first based on small molecules/protein interaction profiling using physico-chemical and geometrical descriptors, the second based on the caracterization of binding site **pharmacophore fingerprints**. I developed a workflow for binding site clustering, comparison and screening using pharmacophore fingerprints. The project is being continued at the MTi.<br>

The « pentameric ion gated-ligand channels » (pGLIC) family pays a key role in the peripheral nervous system; they mediate, through ion conduction, the triggering of action potential. Among this family, anion channels and cation channel respectively have an inhibiting and a stimulating role in neurotransmission. In the 90s, the inhibition of cation channels and the stimulation of anion channels by general anaesthetic (GA) has been evidenced. Still, their mechanism of action remains opaque. Due to difficulties in crystallizing human heteropentamers, the bacterian homolog **GLIC** is being studied at the IBPC. <br>
My objective, in collaboration with Dr. S. Murail et Dr. B. Laurent was to analyse pre-produced **molecular dynamics simulations** of GLIC together with GAs (Bromoform, propofol or desflurane). I studied approximately 5 microseconds of ~150 000 atoms systems to highlight GA transitions within the GLIC receptors. I also studied the changes in pocket volumes, residus angles, helices bending and rotations to understand phenomenon triggered by GA binding.

Bromodomains are epigenetic readers of lysine acetylation; some of them have a key role in acetylation-dependent assembly of transcriptional factors. Few is known about the bromodomain BAZ2B and its physiological role. Some homologies with BAZ2A suggest that it is probably involved in cardiac arrests. 
My objective was to design potential inhibitors of BAZ2B to first help understanding its physiological role. I used a **fragment-based drug design** approach starting from the Lead-now de Zinc Data Base.
