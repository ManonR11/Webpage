Most small molecule drugs interact with proteins at surface cavity levels referred to as protein pockets. Depending on their physico-chemical profiles, small molecules may not only interact with their known partners, but also target unpredicted proteins. The ligands that interact with many divers proteins are called promiscuous ligands. In some cases, their effect can be beneficial; the interaction with an off-target can lead to **drug repurposing**. In other cases, the low selectivity of small molecules lead to deleterious **side effects**.
Thanks to the growing number of *hapo* structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and the availability of PDB derived high quality databases such as **MOAD**, we can caracterize the interaction profiles of frequently co-crystallized small molecules: we can deduce one or more interaction mode(s) that can be further used for off-target prediction.
During my M2 internship, I studied two appraoches: the first based on small molecules/protein interaction profiling using physico-chemical and geometrical descriptors, the second based on the caracterization of binding site pharmacophore fingerprints. I developed a workflow for binding site clustering, comparison and screening using pharmacophore fingerprints as implemented in **FuzCav**. The project is being continued at the MTi.<br>
*Tools*: R, Python, Bash, PockDrug, FuzCav.
